### <span style = "color:blue"> Biophysical mechanisms of CO<sub>2</sub> and water transport inside leaves </span>

We have been working on this topic since 2011. Our object is to reveal the biophysical processes (as well as their coordination) of water and CO<sub>2</sub> movement inside leaves. Recently, two rice recombinant inbred lines populations were developed to identify the relative genes. Up to date, we have published several papers(.i.e Xiong _et al.,_ [2015](https://doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eru434), [2017a](https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.14186), [2017b](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-06460-0) [2018](https://doi.org/10.1111/pce.13111) & Wang _et al.,_ [2018](https://doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ery188)) about this topic. 



### <span style = "color:blue"> The responses of leaf to environmental stresses </span>

Leaf is one of the most sensitive organs to environmental factors including abiotic and biotic stresses. Generally, plants adapt to their local environments by adjusting anatomy (e.g. leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf density and leaf vein traits), and biochemical features including leaf nitrogen content (N), osmolytes, & hormones. However, these adjustments will potentially impact the physiological processes such as leaf carbon assimilation and hydraulics. Revealing the leaf anatomical, biochemical and physiological traits to environmental stresses, which will be more common in the future due to the global climate change, is an important issue for agriculture as well as forest ecology systems. Our aims are (1) to reveal the responses of leaf anatomy and gas exchange to variable environmental factors including water stress, high temperature, shading and nutrition across a broad range of species; (2) to construct ideal leaf anatomy of high source (light, N and water) use efficiency and stress tolerance.

### <span style = "color:blue"> The climate change & food production </span>

The global demand for primary foodstuffs was expected to increase 70% more by 2050, driven by population growth, and demands for livestock products and biofuel. However, the annual yields of main crops are stagnating, and climate change is seriously imperiling crops productions. To clear the yield stagnation and the impact of climate change on crop production, a high-resolution global crop statistics database is constructing. I am now working with my collaborators around the world to answer the questions via “big data”.
