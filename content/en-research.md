### The responses of leaf morphological and physiological traits to environmental changes.

Leaf is one of the most sensitive organs to environmental factors including abiotic and biotic stresses. Typically, leaves adjust leaf anatomy, leaf mass per area (LMA), and leaf nitrogen content (N) to environmental variables. However, these adjustments will potentially impact the leaf carbon accumulation and then plants performance. Revealing the leaf anatomical and physiological traits to environmental stresses, which will be more common in the future due to the global climate change, is an important issue for agriculture as well as forest ecology systems. The aims of this project are (1) to reveal the responses of leaf anatomy and gas exchange to variable environmental factors including high temperature, light intensity and N supplement across a broad ranges of species; (2) to construct leaf anatomy with high source (light, N and water) use efficiency, especially, under variable environmental conditions.

### The climate change & food production (crops)

The global demand for primary foodstuffs was expected to increase 70% more by 2050, driven by population growth, and demands for livestock products and biofuel. However, the annual yields of main crops are stagnating, and climate change is seriously imperiling crops productions. To clear the yield stagnation and the impact of climate change on crop production, a high-resolution global crop statistics database is constructing. We are working with our collaborators around the world to answer the questions with “big data”.
