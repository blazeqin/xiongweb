## <span style = "color:blue"> Biophysical mechanisms of CO<sub>2</sub> and water transport inside leaf </span>

I have been working on this topic since 2011. Basically, I am trying to reveal the biophysical processes (as well as their coordination) of water and CO<sub>2</sub> movement inside leaves. I also published several papers(.i.e [JXB_2015](https://doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eru434), [New Phytologist_2017](https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.14186), [PCE_2018](https://doi.org/10.1111/pce.13111), [JXB_2018](https://doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ery188)) in this field. 



## <span style = "color:blue"> A. The responses of leaf to environmental stresses </span>

Leaf is one of the most sensitive organs to environmental factors including abiotic and biotic stresses. Typically, leaves adjust leaf anatomy, leaf mass per area (LMA), and leaf nitrogen content (N) to environmental variables. However, these adjustments will potentially impact the leaf carbon accumulation and then plants performance. Revealing the leaf anatomical and physiological traits to environmental stresses, which will be more common in the future due to the global climate change, is an important issue for agriculture as well as forest ecology systems. Our aims are (1) to reveal the responses of leaf anatomy and gas exchange to variable environmental factors including water stress, high temperature, shading and nutrition across a broad ranges of species; (2) to construct ideal leaf anatomy of high source (light, N and water) use efficiency and stress tolerance.




## <span style = "color:blue"> The climate change & food production </span>

The global demand for primary foodstuffs was expected to increase 70% more by 2050, driven by population growth, and demands for livestock products and biofuel. However, the annual yields of main crops are stagnating, and climate change is seriously imperiling crops productions. To clear the yield stagnation and the impact of climate change on crop production, a high-resolution global crop statistics database is constructing. I am now working with my collaborators around the world to answer the questions via “big data”.




## <span style = "color:blue"> Other topics </span>

Broad contemplated topics are listed below. 

- Carbon and water economics of plants at multiple levels.

- Rice canopy (dynamic-)photosynthesis estimation and modeling.

- Effects of domestication on crops eco-physiology
